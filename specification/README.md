# Amazon S3 Encryption Client Specification
This library is defined by a specification (spec) in accordance with [RFC2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).
The spec is written in Markdown format with `.md` file extensions.
It is intended to be used with [Duvet](https://github.com/awslabs/duvet) to ensure the code is compliant.

The writing style for prose SHALL be one line per sentence and one sentence per line.
This is to make diffs easier and to prevent lines from growing too long.
This is inspired by:
* [writing one sentence per line](https://sive.rs/1s)
* [Semantic Line Breaks](https://sembr.org/) - only points 1 through 4.
